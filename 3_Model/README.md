## Neural Network Model: Definition and Evaluation

### Implementation Overview
The Jupyter Notebook **neuronales_netz.ipynb** implements a multi-layer neural network designed to enhance predictive accuracy using advanced optimization techniques. The model development process includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation to ensure the highest level of accuracy and generalization.

### Model Selection
The model selection process was guided by the complexity of the problem and the necessity of balancing interpretability and predictive power:
- A **baseline model** was chosen for its simplicity and ease of interpretation. It served as a benchmark to evaluate the improvement provided by more complex architectures.
- The **neural network** was selected because of its capability to learn intricate, nonlinear patterns within the dataset, enabling enhanced predictive performance. The architecture was fine-tuned to ensure optimal efficiency and accuracy.

### Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
- The dataset underwent preprocessing steps including handling missing values, normalization, and transformation to ensure compatibility with the neural network.
- Feature extraction techniques were employed to derive meaningful insights from raw data, optimizing model learning.
- Various activation functions such as **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** were tested to identify the most effective in improving convergence speed and model accuracy.
- Advanced optimization algorithms, including **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**, were implemented to enhance training efficiency and mitigate overfitting.
- Additional feature engineering, such as polynomial feature augmentation and domain-specific transformations, was performed to enrich the dataset and maximize predictive performance.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
To optimize model performance, an extensive hyperparameter tuning process was conducted:
- The tuning process involved adjusting critical parameters such as **the number of layers, neurons per layer, learning rate, batch size, and regularization techniques (dropout, L2 penalty)**.
- Systematic optimization strategies, including **Grid Search** and **Random Search**, were utilized to explore a wide range of configurations and identify the optimal setup.
- **Cross-validation** was implemented to validate the model’s robustness and prevent overfitting by assessing performance on multiple subsets of the dataset.
- Learning rate schedules and adaptive optimizers were analyzed to improve convergence stability and minimize computational overhead.

### Model Training and Execution
- The neural network was trained on a structured dataset split into **training, validation, and test sets** to ensure unbiased evaluation.
- Multiple training iterations were conducted with dynamic learning rate adjustments to facilitate efficient convergence and avoid premature stagnation.
- Performance metrics were logged after each training epoch, enabling thorough analysis and visualization of learning progression.
- The training process incorporated early stopping mechanisms to prevent unnecessary computations and mitigate overfitting risks.

### Evaluation Metrics
The model’s effectiveness was measured using multiple statistical evaluation criteria:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Evaluates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, penalizing larger errors more significantly.
- **R²-Score (Coefficient of Determination)**: Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A value closer to 1 indicates superior explanatory capability.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Computes the average absolute deviation between predictions and actual values, offering a straightforward interpretation of model accuracy.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: A supplementary metric that provides a more interpretable error measure by taking the square root of MSE.
- **Loss function monitoring**: The evolution of the loss function was tracked throughout training to detect underfitting or overfitting trends.

### Summary and Key Takeaways
- The neural network significantly outperformed the baseline model, demonstrating its capacity to capture intricate relationships within the dataset.
- Through rigorous hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering, the model was optimized for superior predictive accuracy and generalizability.
- Evaluation metrics confirmed the effectiveness of the model, with reduced error rates and improved variance explanation.
- This documentation outlines a structured and systematic methodology for building, training, and evaluating deep learning models, ensuring their applicability in real-world scenarios.

Future improvements may include experimenting with more complex architectures and advanced regularization techniques to further enhance model performance.

# Baseline Model

# Implementation of the Baseline Model

The Baseline Model serves as a fundamental reference point for evaluating the performance of more complex machine learning models. It provides an initial benchmark by implementing a simple linear regression model using historical bakery sales data.

# 1. Purpose of the Baseline Model
- **Creates a reference model** for comparison with more advanced approaches such as neural networks.
- **Provides insights** into whether complex models significantly improve prediction accuracy.
- **Helps assess basic trends** in the dataset before applying advanced techniques.

# 2. Implementation Details

## Data Loading and Preprocessing
- The prepared dataset is loaded to ensure proper formatting.
- Missing values in key features (e.g., product categories, sales figures) are removed.
- The timestamp column is converted to a datetime format to enable temporal analysis.

## Linear Regression Model
- The model is implemented using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`.
- The dataset is split into training and test sets to validate model performance.
- The model is trained on historical sales data, using independent variables such as time-related features.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared deviation from actual sales.
- **R² Score**: Determines how well the model explains the variance in sales.
- The baseline performance serves as a minimum standard before implementing advanced models.

# 3. Key Findings
- The model provides a simple trend line of expected sales based on previous observations.
- It allows researchers to determine if additional external factors (such as weather, local events, or promotions) significantly affect sales.
- The achieved metrics (MSE, R² score) help assess whether complex models improve predictive power.

# 4. Rationale for Using Linear Regression
- Linear regression is interpretable and computationally efficient.
- It provides a simple comparison point before introducing non-linear models.
- If the baseline model already shows high predictive accuracy, the added value of more complex techniques may be limited.

# 5. Future Steps
- Use this baseline as a benchmark when testing the neural network.
- Compare the improvements in accuracy and generalization achieved by the advanced model.
- Consider additional feature engineering to refine input variables for both models.

This baseline model establishes a minimum performance threshold that aids in assessing the necessity and effectiveness of advanced machine learning techniques such as neural networks.

# Baseline Model

The Baseline Model serves as a fundamental reference point for evaluating the performance of more complex machine learning models. It provides an initial benchmark by implementing a simple linear regression model using historical bakery sales data.
1. Purpose of the Baseline Model
•	Establishes a reference model to compare with more advanced approaches like neural networks.
•	Provides insights into whether complex models improve predictive accuracy significantly.
•	Helps assess the fundamental trends in the dataset before applying advanced techniques.
2. Implementation Details
•	Data Loading & Preprocessing:
o	The prepared dataset is loaded, ensuring proper formatting.
o	Missing values in key features (e.g., product categories, sales figures) are removed.
o	The timestamp column is converted into a datetime format to enable temporal analysis.
•	Linear Regression Model:
o	The model is implemented using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.
o	The dataset is split into training and test sets to validate model performance.
o	The model is trained on historical sales data, using independent variables such as time-related features.
•	Evaluation Metrics:
o	Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared deviation from actual sales.
o	R² Score: Determines how well the model explains variance in sales.
o	The baseline performance serves as a minimum benchmark before implementing advanced models.
3. Key Results
•	The model provides a simple trendline of expected sales based on past observations.
•	It allows researchers to determine if additional external factors (such as weather, local events, or promotions) significantly influence sales.
•	The achieved metrics (MSE, R² Score) help assess if complex models improve predictive power.
4. Justification for Using Linear Regression
•	Linear regression is interpretable and computationally efficient.
•	It provides a straightforward comparison point before introducing non-linear models.
•	If the baseline model already yields strong predictive accuracy, there may be limited added value from more complex techniques.
5. Future Steps
•	Use this baseline as a benchmark when testing the neural network.
•	Compare the improvements made by the advanced model in terms of accuracy and generalization.
•	Consider additional feature engineering to refine the input variables for both models.
This baseline model establishes a minimum performance threshold that helps in assessing the necessity and effectiveness of advanced machine learning techniques like neural networks.
